# PDF Upload Block - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The PDF upload block feature has been successfully implemented with full integration into the Zyra canvas application.

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. PDF Block Component
- **Upload Functionality**: Users can upload PDF files (up to 10MB) via a button click
- **File Validation**: Validates file type (PDF only) and size before upload
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows upload progress and status indicators
- **PDF Information Display**: Shows filename, file size, and upload date
- **Text Extraction Status**: Displays whether text was successfully extracted from the PDF
- **Actions**: View/Download button to open PDF in new tab, Replace button to upload a new file
- **Canvas Integration**: Fully integrated with React Flow handles (source on top, target on bottom)
- **Connection Hints**: Visual hints to guide users on connecting PDFs to chat blocks

### 2. PDF Upload & Storage
- **Cloudinary Integration**: PDFs are uploaded to Cloudinary with the `raw` resource type
- **Text Extraction**: Uses `unpdf` library to extract text content from PDFs (ESM-compatible, works with Next.js)
- **Database Storage**: PDF metadata and extracted text are stored in PostgreSQL via Prisma
- **Organized Storage**: PDFs are stored in the `zyra-pdfs` folder on Cloudinary

### 3. Context Sharing with Chat Blocks
- **Automatic Detection**: Chat blocks automatically detect connected PDF blocks
- **Text Sharing**: Extracted PDF text is shared with chat blocks when connected
- **Combined Context**: Chat blocks can receive context from both notes and PDFs
- **Clear Formatting**: PDF content is labeled with headers for clarity
- **Status Indicators**: Chat blocks show connection status and data availability

### 4. API Routes
- **POST /api/pdfs**: Upload PDF, extract text, save to database
- **DELETE /api/pdfs**: Delete PDF from database and Cloudinary
- **Authorization**: All endpoints are protected with NextAuth session validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages

### 5. TanStack Query Integration
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback during operations
- **Cache Management**: Efficient caching and invalidation strategies
- **Custom Hooks**:
  - `useCreatePDF()` - Upload and create PDF
  - `useDeletePDF()` - Delete PDF
  - `usePDFsFromCache()` - Get all PDFs for a canvas
  - `usePDFContent()` - Get extracted text for a specific PDF block
